# Experimenting wiht the Location/Activity Recognition Google API
The main idea here is to trigger notifications depending on Activity state
(mostly when transitioning from Idle to Active).

Mostly a WIP, experimenting project, so not much to see here!


Update: As of March 2018, the newer version of the location library includes
an _activity transition_ API. I was detecting the transitions manually, so
moving the the newer API if it works fine (for some reason I am getting
timestamps way in the future, but have to test more).
